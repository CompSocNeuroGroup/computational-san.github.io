<p>Social and affective neuroscience is a burgeoning research field focused on understanding how the brain processes social and affective information. Computational techniques play a critical role in modeling these processes, but most programs do not currently provide adequate training. Training students in computational techniques in graduate programs, workshops, and tutorials is an extraordinarily challenging endeavor due to high levels of variability in (a) mathematical and computer backgrounds, (b) interest in theory vs applications, and (c) computer operating systems and software packages. The goal of this community is to provide a forum for sharing training resources and tutorials in specific computational techniques.
